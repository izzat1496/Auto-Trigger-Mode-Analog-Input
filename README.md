# Auto-Trigger-Mode-Analog-Input
In this project, we will create a program that continuously prints out the analog value of PC3 (A3 Analog pin) through the serial port. Assuming that clock speed of Arduino at 16MHz, desired clock speed of ADC is 125kHz, using AVCC as analog reference and on-demand mode.
